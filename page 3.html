<h1>UGA! UGA! UGA!</h1>

<p> I am a huge Georgia football fan. I have watched the dawgs play on Saturday for as long as I can remember ,and no I didn't spell dawgs wrong! That just how we spell it at UGA.
Both of my parents grew up in Georgia and both graduated from UGA, I know what you're thinking I'm a long way from family tradition.  </p>

<p>If you are a UGA fan then you know of one very famous announcer. A man held up as much in fame as the great players of the past. A man by the name of Larry Muson</p>
