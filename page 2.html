  <p> I have a few facts about Halloween that you may be interested in.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Halloween is more Irish than ST. Patricks day. Halloween's origins come from a Celtic festival for the dead called"Samhain"</li>
  <li>Costumes use to be made from animal skin and heads.</li>
  <li>Jack-o'-lanterns where once made from turnips, beets, and potatoes</li>
  <li>Studies have shown that Halloween actually makes kids act more "evil", so watch out around your house.</li>
